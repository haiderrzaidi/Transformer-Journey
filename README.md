# Hands-On LLaMA: A Journey into the Depths of Language Models

Welcome to **Hands-On LLaMA**, a private playground where theory meets practice. This repository is dedicated to diving deep into the lower-level workings of language models, with a focus on testing, experimenting, and truly understanding the nuts and bolts of model training, architecture, and evaluation.

## Why This Repository?

In the fast-paced world of AI, it's easy to get lost in the abstraction of high-level libraries and pre-trained models. But the real magic happens when you get your hands dirty with the core components. This repository is my personal exploration into:

- **Building from Scratch**: Implementing components from papers like LLaMA, starting from a simple model and progressively scaling up.
- **Learning by Doing**: Moving beyond theoretical understanding by coding and testing different aspects of language models.
- **Iterative Development**: Embracing the process of incremental improvements, debugging, and refining model components.

## Goals

- **Understand the Basics**: Start with foundational concepts and build upon them.
- **Test and Experiment**: Try out different ideas, from tokenization techniques to Transformer layers.
- **Document the Journey**: Keep track of progress, challenges, and learnings in this repository.

## What's Inside?

- **/src**: Core implementation files where the magic happens.
- **/notebooks**: Jupyter notebooks for interactive experiments and visualizations.
- **/data**: Sample datasets for training and testing models.
- **/logs**: Training logs and model performance metrics.

## How to Use This Repository

This is a private repository for personal use, but the general structure is designed for iterative learning. Feel free to explore different branches for various experiments and see how different ideas come together.

## Future Plans

- Incorporate more advanced features like RoPE embeddings, attention mechanisms, and layer scaling.
- Experiment with various optimizers and training schedules.
- Compare results with pre-trained models and analyze performance.

## Disclaimer

This repository is a work in progress, and it's as much about the journey as it is about the destination. Expect some rough edges and a few dead endsâ€”after all, that's the essence of learning!

Happy coding and experimenting!
